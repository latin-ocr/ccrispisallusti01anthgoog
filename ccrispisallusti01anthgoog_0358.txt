81 l. Aestioorum, ‘f ol the summercampaign.'’ Amtioo, strict-
ly speaking, is an adjective like hiberno, and has castro ua-
derstood. ‘In Tacitus, Aac. 1. 16. 2, we have the ellipsis sup·
ι plied: “ Castris aestivis lres smol legiones habebantur.''

2. Quantum temporis, dcc, ξ’ during as much ol the summor
campaign as he was in command?

3. Dedecehaatur. Dedncere is here used in the sense os di·
ducere, (compare Cart. od loc.) and the clause may hcrender·
ed ι “ the watches were not distributed according to military
usage.” ’ , , ,Α ’ ’

4. Licea. Festus detines the liceo as follows: “ Lisac,qui
cursitem sequuntur, quaestus gratia: dicti quod astra ordirrom r
sint militine, eisque liceat, qnod libuerit. Alii eos a Ls'clsc appel
lotos dicant, qnod ct illc Herculem sit secutam: quidem c ligurien-
do quaestum.’' Nonius explains the name thus: cicorum pro·
prietes llaec ost, quod officium sustineant aedilibus noane replendae.
Lixam nomque aquam ceteros rocaverunt ,· unde elixum dirimas
aqua coctum.’' Vossius prefers derIving the term from elixare,

diers. Independent os its referring to the soldiers' servants
aad to the sutlers, tlre name appears to have been occasionally
also applied to buffoons. This last meaning os the word rests
on a passage in Justin, (38. 10.) where, under the general

A name of lires, are comprehended coqui, pistores, and amnesi.

' Justin is speakingof the army which Antiochus led against the
partums, ‘⁴ Sed insamae non nrinor appareres, qnam militiae
suit : quippe octoginta miden armatorum secuta ssent trecenta mil-
lio lixarum, cr: quihus coquorum, pistorum, scenmornmqvc, major
numerus snit.¹' Cortius makes lianc, in the passage of Sallust
to which this note rosus, signily all manner of disorderly per· ¹
sons. lt may, however, be better rendered, we conceive, ‘⁴ the

¹ l'ollowers of the camp.''

5. Die. Some editions have din.

6. Vollcs, “ country-seats‚’' or ¹‘ villas.’'

7. Pensm, dcc. This was -in violation of ,the strict rules ol
military discipline. Besides pay, each soldier received a eer-
tarn allowance of corn, commonly sour pecks (modii) a
mouth. This they were to grind, sist, andprepare lor breed
