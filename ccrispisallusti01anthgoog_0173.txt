verument. The thirdhermgue was delivered by the Tribune
Licinius. lt was an eliort oi that demagoguc'to depress the petri·
sien, and raise the tribunitiai, power3 sor which purpose he alter-
nately flatters the people and reviles the Senatu. The oration oi
Marcus Cotta is unqucstionebly atine one. He uddressed⁴ it to
the pcople, during the period oi his consulship, in order to calm
their minds, end alley their resentment at the' bed successes public
elfelm which, without any blame on his pert, hed iately, iu many
respecls, been conducted to an unprosperous issue. Ol tire two
letters which are entant, the one is irem Pompey to the Senete,
complaining in very strong terms ol the deliciency in¹ the supplies

forthe aruty which he commended in Spain against Sertorius; ’
the other is* supposed to bc addressed srom Mithridates to Arsaces,
king ef Parthia, andto be written when the affairs os the former
monerch were proceeding nnsuecesslully. It exhorts him, never-
thelees, with great eloquence and power oi argument, to join him
in nn allience against the Romans: ior this purpose, it places in
a strong point ol view their unprincipled policy‚ end ambitious
desire oi universal empire-all which could not, without this
device, oi an imaginary letter by e foe, have been so well urged ¹
by a national historien. lt concludes with showing the extreme
danger which the Parthicus would incur· irem the hostility oi
the Romans, should they succeed in finally subjugating Pontus
¹ and Armenia. The onlyflther fragment of any length, is the¹ ¹
description oi a splendid entertainment given to Metellus, on
his return, citer a year’s absence irom his government ol Fer·
ther Spain. It appears, from several other fragments, that Sai-
iust had introduced, on occasion ol the Mithridatio war, a geo·
