tciilieo. No alteration, we conceive, is necessary. Scilicet is 78
used by the historian as an' affirmative particle, and we may
render the clause as follows: “those things which prosperity ι
isaccustomed to produce, licentiousness, namely, and pride,-
came 'naturally upon them.'’ Licentionsness and pride, 'the
usual attendants ol prosperity, naturally made their appear·
ance.

1. Asperius acerbiusque suit. Understand quum ipsueres cd· 79
versae, “proved a harsher and more galling visitation than '
adversity itsell had heen.'' ’ “

2. Dignitutm An elegant zeugma operates in lubidinem,

’ which has one meaning when connected with dignitatem, and
another when joined in construction with libertatem. Thus,
dignumne in lubidinem venere, means ‘⁶ to convert their high
rank into an instrument of tyranny ;'’ and libertatem in lubidi-

3. Ducere, “dishonestly acquired.'’ Ducere here densiter·
fraud, while repere and trabere imply violence. These words,
arranged as they are in the tent, are employed to express the
progress of corruption, commencing with dishonest and clan-
destine practices, and rising gradually tc bold and unpunished
violence. ,

t. Saluta atque dispersu iu meillitudine, “ disunited and divid·
ed amongalarge number.'’ Cortius places a comma alter dis·
perse and makes in multitudine equivalent to quamuis mubi es·
unt.- “ notwithstanding their numbers.'' Burnoul adopts the
seme interpretation. We cannot, however, perceive the pro·
prietyof such a mode cf explanation. The meaning ol the
historian is evidently this: that the nobility, although inferior
in numerical strength to their opponente, were, notwithstand-
