rendered as follows: “ For. the discharge of the dnties of the ,
consulship, though posterior, in point of time, totbe being
elected consul, isin reality prior to tt, as regards the trutlr it· ³
self and the advantages resulting to the state.”· The idea in-
tended to be con'veyed is this: In strictness of language, no
’ one can be said to hold a station, the consulship, for example,
until he is appointed to it hythe suffrages of the people. And
yet, if we take into consideration the faithful discharge of offi-
cial duties and tlre advantages thence resulting to the state, ¹
we must admit that qualifications and experience are prior in
the scale of importance to tbe mere formal appointment to ³
office. In a word,'they alone are true consuls, who are quali-
· hedto discharge correctly thev duties of the consulship, when
theypresent themselves before the people as candidates for
that high stati0n; and the administratiou of such meu only will =
prove beneficial to tbe state. ’
