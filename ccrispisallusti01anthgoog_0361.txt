6. Commeatum mare, “ lo carry his provisions.” The nd-
vantage resulting to the Mmans from this offer would be, the
releasing oi the soldiers and beasts oi burthen from the heavy

7. El insidiis locam tentari. We heve given tentari in the
texhiustend alternare as most editions read. The meaning
is, “ audibat a place ht lor an ambuscade was sought by the
enemy :” matari being here equivalent to quaeri. This is an
emendation which we owe to Gronovius. Cortius, however,
condemns it, end reads mare, before which he supposes the
words homines madum, or something equivalent, to be under·
stood. Others make tentare the historica} infinitiva, and reler
it to Metellus z· “ he eramiued the place lo discover en ambus· ,
eade.'’ According to both of these explanatione, however,
the reading tentare wenta spirit. Tartari ie given in the Bipont
edition.
