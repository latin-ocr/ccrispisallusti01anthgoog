83 l. Huic συκαῖ, &a We' heve here followed the reading
οἳ the Bipont edition, which alone appears to afford an intelli-
glhle meaning atthis much contested passage. The phrase
hnic praesidium imposuit is the true Latin idiom, though in hans-
latiag ’rt lato our idiom, we are compelled to give huie the
meaning os anablatlve. The meaning ol tha whole‘passage
isasfollows: ⁴⁴ ln this place the consul stationed agarrison,
as well forthe sake of sounding the real intentione os Jugur·
tha, (i. e. ol ascertaining whether he really desired peace, or
was only seelxlng to lay an ambuscadc) as of walching the re·

xsalt of hls own plans, (i. e. the assassination ot* J ugurtha by his,
own ambassadors,) if the advantages the place uffordedshould
allow this to be done. (i. e. if, upon trial, the place should
prove es advantageous for these two objects as he expected.)
The reading adopted by Cortips is this: Hac conntl, simul ten·
tandi gratia, adpeterent opportunitates loci praesidium imposuit .·
Heresers the particle simul back to the preceding sentence,
aud makes Metellus to have ,been influenced in the step he
took, both by the circumstance ol there beingmany Roman
trudeus iu the city, and, atate sante tinae, hythe wish of ascer-
taining whether the advantages the place ufforded would he
“ open to his use. This mode of explaining the passage appears
te ustoo harah, end the latter part extremely obscure, it' not

actually unintelligible. ’
2. Forent. Some editions add comportare efter thisword.

3. Frequentiarn negotiatorum, dcc. 'I'he reading which we
have adopted in our text is that os the Bipont edition, except
- ing the words el jamfnhtch we have substituted sor stam.
'l'he meaning ol the whole passage will be as follows: “ hav
ingimagined, asin lect the case itsell' suggested, that the grea¹
number of merchents who dwelt in the place, and ot' person.
who were wont to visit tf sor the purposes os· trade, would preve
au mistence to his army, and he a means os secarity to the
conquesta he had already made ;” i. e. would supply hls troop-
with provisions, uc, and, by their presence, sidia keeplug
moveaturne inhabitants of the place in subjection: sor hy
heth “gelware aad eamus, Roman aitiaeas are arunt.
